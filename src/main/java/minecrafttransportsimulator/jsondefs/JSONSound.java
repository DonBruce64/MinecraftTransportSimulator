Inhibitor and activator transforms may be used in conjunction with these for advanced on/off logic.  Note that non-looping sounds are only played when all the animations in this block change the visibility state from 0 to 1.  If you want the sound to play every tick the visibility state is at 1, set repeating to true.")

    @JSONDescription("A listing of animation objects for the volume.  Leaving this blank will make for a volume of 1.0.  Translation and rotation transforms are used to adjust the volume.\nTranslation will adjust the volume linearly.  Rotation will adjust the volume in a parabolic fashion.  Both of these use a formuala type of Volume=function(variable), with the offset being used to offset the value returned by the function.\nTranslations are linear transforms, and use a formula in the form of: Volume=axis.y*variableValue + offset.  Rotations are parabolic, and use a formula in the form of: Volume=axis.x*(axis.y*variableValue - axis.z)^2 + offset.  Between these two, you have full control of the sound's volume.\nNote that volume is clamped to a minimum value of 0 when the sound is played, with sounds lower than 0 being mute.  You may add additional clamping via the clamping animations, but the resulting volume, even if not affected by the animation clamps, will still be clamped at a lower bound of 0 when the sound is actually played.\nAs an example: If you have a sound like a road noise or wind noise, you would want that sound to normally be silent until hitting a specific speed, say 0.2.  You would then want it to increase in volume, up to a max of 1.0, when you hit 0.8.  As such, you'd use a translation variable, with the axis set to [0, 0, 1.66], and an offset of -0.332.  This would result in the linear formula Volume=1.66*speed - 0.332.  So up until you got to a speed of 0.2, the volume would be 0.  After that, it would increase linearly until you reached a speed of 0.8, and the volume became 1.0.")
