/**
 * Base entity class.  This class is the base for all in-game entities.  What these
 * entities are is up to the extending class.  They could be players, vehicles, blocks,
 * guns, etc.  The key part here is this base class keeps track of all these entities, and
 * is responsible for assigning them a global ID number when created.  This can be used to
 * obtain their instances via packets as the ID is the same between clients and servers.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that all entities of this type never "load" saved data.  Rather, they are created from it.
 * This means that there is no method call to load properties from data. Instead, data required
 * for loading will be passed-in to the constructor.  This data should be used to create the entity
 * in its loaded state.  For saving, which can happen multiple times in the entity's lifetime,
 * {@link #save(IWrapperNBT)} is called.  All data required in the constructor should be saved there.
