/**Custom class for selectors.  Selectors are like buttons, except they allow for side-sensitive clicking.
 * Their {@link #onClicked()} method takes a boolean parameter that allows them to perform different actions 
 * depending on their state.  This allows for multi-state selectors that can be clicked, rather that two-
 * state buttons.  It is assumed the selector will have a custom texture area as it will need
 * to be offset for every click, so the long-form constructor is the only one available here.  Note that
 * the text passed-in will be rendered below the selector rather than at the center like buttons.
 * Additional labels may be desired should more descriptions be needed.
