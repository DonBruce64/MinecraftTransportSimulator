     *  server when the server gets a packet that the player has interacted with a vehicle.  Actions should
     *  be taken at this point.
     *  {@link CallbackType#PLAYER} will send this interaction back to the player  that initiated it, while 
     *  {@link CallbackType#ALL} will send this to all players that have this vehicle loaded.
     *  {@link CallbackType#NONE} will abort processing and will prevent any packets from being sent.
     *  {@link CallbackType#SKIP} passes over this item an allow for further vehicle processing.  Useful for items
     *  that may only be active sometimes  based on their state, and shouldn't impede other vehicle interactions.
     *  {@link CallbackType#ALL_AND_MORE} will return the packet like ALL, but will also continue processing like SKIP.
     *  <br><br>
     *  NOTE: When this method is called on the server, the passed-in player is the player clicking the vehicle.
     *  However, when the callback packet is sent to trigger this method on clients, the player instance is the
     *  client player for that client, NOT the player who initially interacted with the vehicle.  Because of 
     *  this, any client-side interactions that need to know something about the player who initially interacted 
     *  with this vehicle should NOT use {@link CallbackType#ALL}, as this will not give the "correct" player instance.
