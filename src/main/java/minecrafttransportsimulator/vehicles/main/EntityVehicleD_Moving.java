	 *  This needs to be called before checking pitch and roll of ground devices.  It is responsible for ensuring that

	 *  ground devices are collided it will add motionY to a level that the least-collided ground device will no longer collide.
	 *  If motionY is positive, then it will add motionY to prevent either the front or rear ground devices from colliding, but only
	 *  if motionPitch is non-zero.  This is for vehicles that rotate when flying and need to pivot on their ground devices.
	 *  Finally, if motionY is negative, and only the rear ground devices are collided, but motionPitch is also negative, it will
	 *  add motionY to get those out of the ground.  This is also for flying vehicles, in that they normally pitch down (positive)
	 *  due to gravity, but if they are trying to pitch up we need to allow them to do so.

	 *  from motionY after the vehicle is moved, as it's not a force and will cause the physics system to behave badly if
	 *  it is left in.  The only exception is if we had motionY that we shouldn't have applied in the first place, such as
	 *  if motionY was moving us into the ground.  In this case, we need to keep this as a force as it's force the ground is
