/**Class designed to represent a renderable object.  Said object has at minimum some
 * geometry, though this can be a cached set of vertices or a hard-coded saved set.
 * It will also have a texture, though this texture may be a single solid white sheet
 * for shader-compatible solid rendering.  In this case, the color will be specified,
 * and should be used to change the color prior to rendering.  Various other properties
 * exist for lighting/blending.  In all cases, similar renderable objects should be
 * grouped together and batch-rendered for efficiency.  The primary grouping should be
 * texture, as this prevents re-binds.  Secondary will be color.  Lighting will usually
 * dictate when the object can render rather than in what order (solid vs translucent pass).
 * To assist with this, the equals() method checks texture and color and, if they are identical,
 * returns true.  This allows for said objects to be used as map-keys for easier grouping.
 * Note that this does NOT include the actual vertex data in this equality check.
