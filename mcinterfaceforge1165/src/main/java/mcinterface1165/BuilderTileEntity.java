/**
 * Builder for the MC Tile Entity class   This class interfaces with all the MC-specific
 * code, and is constructed on the server automatically by MC.  After construction, a tile entity
 * class that extends {@link ATileEntityBase} should be assigned to it.  This is either
 * done manually on the first placement, or automatically via loading from NBT.
 * <br><br>
 * Of course, one might ask, "why not just construct the TE class when we construct this one?".
 * That's a good point, but MC doesn't work like that.  MC waits to assign the world and position
 * to TEs, so if we construct our TE right away, we'll end up with TONs of null checks.  To avoid this,
 * we only construct our TE after the world and position get assigned, and if we have NBT
 * At that point, we make the TE if we're on the server.  If we're on the client, we always way
 * for NBT, as we need to sync with the server's data.
