 * Interface to the MC client instance.  This class has methods used for determining
 * if the game is paused, the chat window status, and a few other things.
 * This interface interfaces with both Forge and MC code, so if it's something
 * that's core to the client and doesn't need an instance of an object to access, it's likely here.
 * Note that this interface will not be present on servers, so attempting to access it on such
 * will return null.
