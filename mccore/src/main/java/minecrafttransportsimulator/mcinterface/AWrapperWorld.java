/**
 * IWrapper to a world instance.  This contains many common methods that
 * MC has seen fit to change over multiple versions (such as lighting) and as such
 * provides a single point of entry to the world to interface with it.  Note that
 * clients and servers don't share world objects, and there are world objects for
 * every loaded world, so multiple objects will always be present on a system.
 * Unlike everything else in the interface system, this is an abstract class.
 * This is required as we need to bolt-on an entity manager to it upon construction.
