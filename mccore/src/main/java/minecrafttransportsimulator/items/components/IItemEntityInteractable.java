     * be taken at this point.
     * {@link CallbackType#PLAYER} will send this interaction back to the player  that initiated it, while

     * {@link CallbackType#NONE} will abort processing and will prevent any packets from being sent.
     * {@link CallbackType#SKIP} passes over this item an allow for further entity processing.  Useful for items
     * that may only be active sometimes  based on their state, and shouldn't impede other entity interactions.

     * NOTE: When this method is called on the server, the passed-in player is the player clicking the entity.
     * However, when the callback packet is sent to trigger this method on clients, the player instance is the
     * client player for that client, NOT the player who initially interacted with the entity.  Because of
     * this, any client-side interactions that need to know something about the player who initially interacted
     * with this entity should NOT use {@link CallbackType#ALL}, as this will not give the "correct" player instance.
