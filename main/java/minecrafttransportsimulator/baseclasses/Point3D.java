/**This class is essentially a wrapper for a 3D point in space.  It contains multiple
 * methods used for point manipulation.  Most importantly, the point's values are NOT
 * static, which means no more of the crap of making new class instances when we want
 * to move the point.  It also allows for cleaner modification in the code by applying
 * deltas to the point instead of re-making the point entirely.
 * 
 * Note that this class does not contain functions for vector math such as dot and
 * cross products that the vector systems in MC have.  Use vectors for vectors, and
 * points for points.
